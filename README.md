# University of Minnesota Coding Boot Camp - Fall 2020 
## Assignment #02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio


### Overview

The focus of this assignment was to learn the ability to apply Bootstrap components to quickly build and deploy a 
functioning, good looking, and responsive website that optimally performs on various screen sizes and device platforms.  Many steps were taken by the development team to achieve these goals, and they are documented as follows:

* Built initial file system structure and deployed basic blueprint to Github to begin the repository.
* Sketched out basic wireframe layout for website's Bootcamp grid system.
* Constructed main index.html page guided by Chrome Developer Tools ensuring continual responsiveness.
* Used completed index.html as template for contact.html and portfolio.html
* Inserted unique content for contact.html and portfolio.html utilizing the index template.
* Used semantic HTML naming for elements.
* Implemented Bootsteap navbar template for customization.
* Integrated media queries for screen at 400px, 768px and 992px.
* Verified HTML code was error free via third party code validation service (**W3C Markup Validation Service**)
* Ensured code was properly commented.
* Wrote README.MD file.
    

### Personal Note Regarding This Assignment

**Please note:** Due to religious/personal conflicts, i have chosen to not include any personal information about myself,
beyond my real name, in this mock portfolio website.  While the final instructions specifically mention this requirement, they also give a (slightly) conflicting assignment:

*"Your app does not need to be **exactly** like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout."*

**This leads me to believe I was tasked to make something very similar - but not identical - to the examples, which I did.**

I do not keep social media accounts, interact with anyone on the internet, nor do i disclose any of my personal information anywhere that could be made public.  Also, it seems frivolous to require biography information and social media links, but then have us leave the *Portfolio* and *Contact* sections as empty, mock placeholders.  

I apologize if this conflicts with the requirements of the course, and I understand if I will lose points.  I feel the ultimate goal of this assingment was to teach Bootstrap component integration and how to use media queries to build responsive layouts based on screen sizes.  **In my opinion, I have confidentally achieved those goals.**  Thank you for respecting my privacy.  

**Side Note:** For whatever reason, this week's homework instructions do not mention how many percentage points each requirement is worth.  Week one and week three both have percentage breakdowns.  This would be helpful for students like myself who may choose to defer a requirement knowing the rest of the assignment protocols were met.  For instance, if leaving out personal information were only 7-10% of my grade, one  could still achieve an "A" grade.  But, if for some strange reason this requirement was worth 50%, then I might have to reluctantly reconsider my personal privacy policy when it comes ot the internet.  For now, I will take my chances.
