# University of Minnesota Coding Boot Camp - Fall 2020 
## Assignment #02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio


### Overview

The focus of this assignment was to learn the ability to apply Bootstrap components to quickly build and deploy a 
functioning, good looking, and responsive website that optimally performs on various screen sizes and device platforms.  Many steps were taken by the development team to achieve these goals, and they are documented as follows:

* Built initial file system structure and deployed basic blueprint to Github to begin the repository.
* Sketched out basic wireframe layout for website's Bootcamp grid system.
* Constructed main index.html page guided by Chrome Developer Tools ensuring continual responsiveness.
* Used completed index.html as template for contact.html and portfolio.html
* Inserted unique content for contact.html and portfolio.html utilizing the index template.
* Used semantic HTML naming for elements.
* Implemented Bootsteap navbar template for customization.
* Integrated media queries for screen at 400px, 768px and 992px.
* Verified HTML code was error free via third party code validation service (**W3C Markup Validation Service**)
* Ensured code was properly commented.
* Wrote README.MD file.
    
### Personal Note Regarding Project

**Please Note:** I do not own any social media accounts, so the contact page links to specific platform's home pages instead.

### Installation

Installation should be fairly straightforward, but here's a quick guide to get up and running, assuming you have **Visual Studio Code** and **Git** (with the accompanying interface **Git Bash**) installed.

* from your shell input the command: `git clone https://github.com/infiniteoo/homework_week_02_responsive_portfolio.git`
* once downloaded, from the working directory in the shell input the command: `code .`
